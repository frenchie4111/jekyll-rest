Jekkyl Rest
-----------

This project is intended to create a clean rest api documentation solution
that can be hosted on github pages.

The following are the core requirements:

- Files are human readable: Files should be able to be read without the 
assistance of github pages
- All REST information documented: The following fields should be documented
about an endpoint
    - Endpoint
    - Authentication method for endpoint
    - Fields
- Easily reusable: Should be able to be droped-in easily
